# Semantic Segmentation with Deep Learning and OpenCV

In this project i used a pretrained deep learning architecture ENet(Efficient Neural Network) and OpenCV and performed semantic segmentation on a video of a car driving in the streets of Toronto and on some inmages from Cityscapes dataset. This model was able to achieve inference by making predictions on labels for every pixel, so that each pixel is labeled with the class of its enclosing object region with some colour.
